# Robot Control Panel

A simple web-based application to control a robot's movement and store/retrieve direction data.

---

## Features
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easily control robot directions (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop) using a web-based control panel.
- **Data Persistence**: Automatically saves direction inputs into a database for tracking.
- **Direction Retrieval**: Displays the latest direction input, ensuring real-time updates.

---

## Requirements
- **XAMPP**: Local server for Apache and MySQL.
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting to handle data interactions.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing and retrieving directions.

---

## How It Works
1. **Control Panel**: Access the web interface to send movement commands to the robot.
2. **Database**: Commands are saved into a MySQL database for persistent tracking.
3. **Last Direction**: Retrieve and display the most recent direction through a dedicated page.

---

**Purpose**: This project demonstrates basic interaction between a web interface and a database, making it a great example for beginners in web development and robotics integration.
